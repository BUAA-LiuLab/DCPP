# DrugComb
We design a multimodal-reinforced deep learning (Drug-Comb) approach to predict the co-assembly capabilities of two drug molecules. Drug-Comb consists of three models: multimodal-reinforced molecular co-assembly prediction model Mol-CA Net, co-assembly interpretation model and drug-pathway prediction model.
